# Blockchain-Based Voting with ZK Proofs

## Project Description

This project implements a secure, transparent, and anonymous voting system using blockchain technology combined with zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The system ensures voter privacy while maintaining the integrity and verifiability of the voting process. Built on Ethereum-compatible networks, this smart contract enables decentralized governance and democratic decision-making processes.

The voting system utilizes cryptographic commitments and nullifier hashes to prevent double voting while preserving voter anonymity. Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency of results without revealing individual voting choices or voter identities.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize democratic processes by creating a trustless, transparent, and privacy-preserving voting infrastructure that can be used for:

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance**
- **Corporate shareholder voting**
- **Community decision-making processes**
- **Academic and institutional elections**
- **Public referendums and civic engagement**

Our vision extends beyond traditional voting to enable any community or organization to conduct secure, verifiable elections without relying on centralized authorities or compromising voter privacy.

## Key Features

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ and npm
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Ethereum testnet access (Goerli, Sepolia)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Blockchain-Based-Voting-with-ZK-Proofs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Goerli testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

# Verify contract on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network goerli <contract-address>
```

## Usage Examples

### Voter Registration
```solidity
// Generate commitment (off-chain)
bytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voterSecret, randomNonce));

// Register voter
contract.registerVoter(commitment);
```

### Creating a Proposal
```solidity
// Only admin can create proposals
contract.createProposal("Proposal Title", "Detailed description of the proposal");
```

### Casting a Vote
```solidity
// Generate nullifier and proof (off-chain)
bytes32 nullifierHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voterSecret, proposalId));
bytes32 zkProof = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(commitment, nullifierHash, block.chainid));

// Cast anonymous vote
contract.castVote(proposalId, true, nullifierHash, zkProof); // true = yes vote
```

## Security Considerations

- Always verify ZK proofs in production implementations
- Use secure random number generation for commitments
- Implement proper access controls and rate limiting
- Regular security audits and formal verification
- Monitor for unusual voting patterns
